Your Information
##################

When you create an account on edX, some basic information is required,
including your email address and your name. Only edX has access to this
information.
    
You can also provide additional, optional information when you create your
account. For example, this information includes the level of education you
have completed. Course teams for the edX courses that you take can access
this information to learn about the people who are enrolling in their course.
    
After you create your edX account, you can also provide information for a
personal profile. Your profile can include an image that identifies you on the
edX site as well as your location and other biographical information. The
course teams and the other learners in the courses that you take can view your
profile.

You can view and change your basic, additional, and profile information at any
time. You access your information by selecting the arrow next to your username
in the upper-right corner of any edX page and then selecting either **Account
Settings** or **My Profile**.
