When you create an account on edX, you specify some *basic information* such as
a username and email address. This information is required for every edX
account, and only edX sees this information.

Optionally, you can also share some *additional information* that helps edX
create better courses. This information is visible to edX, and non-identifying
data, such as the number of learners in a particular country or region, is
visible to course staff. The information is not associated with your username.

Additionally, you can create a *profile* that you can share with edX, course
staff, and other learners to help build a worldwide edX community. Your
profile can include an image that identifies you on the edX site as well as
your location and other biographical information. You can share a limited
profile or a full profile.

You can view and change your basic, additional, and profile information at any
time. Basic and additional information appears on your **Account Settings**
page, while profile information appears on your profile page.

You can also link your edX account to your Facebook or Google account. When you
link your accounts, you can sign in to edX automatically by signing in to
