Coming Soon

The following list describes features that are currently in development and
that edX expects to release in the near future. After these features are
released, we will add a link to related documentation.

****************
Learner Profiles 
****************

Learners and staff will soon be able to introduce themselves to the edX
community through personal profiles. A profile can include an image, a
personal introduction, and other information. Learners can access each
others' profiles from within the course discussions.

Additionally, a new **Account Settings** page will be available. Learners use
this page to update their account information, such as email addresses and
passwords, and demographic information, such as level of education and country
or region.

*************
Student Notes
*************

A new Student Notes tool allows learners in some courses to highlight and make
notes about text directly in the courseware. Learners can see individual notes
in the courseware or all notes together on a new **Notes** tab in the LMS.
