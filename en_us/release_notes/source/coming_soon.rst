Coming Soon

The following list describes features that are currently in development and
that edX expects to release in the near future. After these features are
released, we will add a link to related documentation.

****************
Learner Profiles 
****************

Learners and staff will soon be able to introduce themselves to the edX
community through personal profiles. A profile can include an image, a
personal introduction, and other information. Additionally, a new **Account
Settings** page will soon be available. Learners use this page to update user
account information, such as email addresses and passwords, and demographic
information, such as amount of education completed and country or region.

*************
Student Notes
*************

A new Student Notes tool allows learners in some courses to highlight and make
notes about text directly in the courseware. Learners can see individual notes
in the courseware or all notes together on a new **Notes** tab in the LMS.
